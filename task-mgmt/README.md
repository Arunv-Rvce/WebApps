## Issues
  - While creating the user it creates but throws the exception
  - We need counter for id's i have created a counter which retreives the counter obj but while saving it back it breaks Ex for user "U1, U2" and for task "T1, T2" etc.,
  - We need to have a clear vision of which are the common modules and how is different modules services going to commuinicate with each other
